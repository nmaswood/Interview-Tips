# Why?

Recruiting 2016 is over and these are a collection of things that are fresh in my head now that I wouldn't want to forget later

# Asking the Right Questions

### Technical

* What sort of data structures/ alg paradigms do you think are a good idea to use?
* How would you approach this problem?
* Would utilizing the previous's problems solution help me at all?
* What Time Complexity are you looking for?
* How can I  optimize this further?
* What kind of unit tests/ comments would you like to write?

### Non-Technical

* What was something that really surprised you on the job?
* What are most people unprepared for when onboarding?
* What are the mentorship oppurtunities?
* What is distinct about the culture there?

# Having the Right Responses

* Everyone is going to ask you about a project you've done, so have one mind and be really prepared to talk about it
    * The challenges you faced
    * How you learned
    * What went right/ wrong
    * Did you work with a team?
* Have a good reason why you want to work there, don't sound rehearsed because people can tell, but have a short, compelling reason.
* Do a little research on the company's open source/blog if its out there

# Misc
* Use a head set, typing can get noisey af especially if you type like me and that can get distracting!
* These things can be kind of shit show, but no matter what just stay calm and have fun
* Always be good/nice to the recruiter, if it doesn't work out maybe it will next year
* It's only a tech job ... chill out...
* Make your online portfolio available and have that personal website good to go.
* Apply and interview as much as you can its always good practice and you learn a lot.
* Maintain cordial connections with pretty much everyone you never know who can refer you.
